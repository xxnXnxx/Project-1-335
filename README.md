# Execution:
Algorithm 1: Wildlife Monitoring System
1.	Create a Python file (e.g., algo1.py) and paste the pseudocode into it.
2.	Implement the neighbors(coordinates, current) function to find the neighboring coordinates of a given coordinate.
3.	Replace the placeholder values in the sample Input section with your desired data.
4.	Run the script using a Python interpreter.
5.	The output will be either "Loop detected" or "No loop detected".

Algorithm 2: Greedy Approach to Hamiltonian Problem
1.	Create a Python file (e.g., algo2.py) and paste the pseudocode into it.
2.	Replace the placeholder values in the sample Input section with your desired data.
3.	Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4.	The output will be the index of the preferred starting city.
